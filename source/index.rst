===============================
*EMQ X* - MQTT Messaging Broker
===============================

*EMQ X* is a distributed, massively scalable, highly extensible MQTT message broker written in Erlang/OTP.

*EMQ X* is fully open source and licensed under the Apache Version 2.0. *EMQ X* implements both MQTT V3.1/V3.1.1 and V5.0 protocol specifications, and supports MQTT-SN, CoAP, WebSocket and STOMP at the same time.

*EMQ X* provides a scalable, reliable, enterprise-grade MQTT message Hub for IoT, M2M, Smart Hardware and Mobile Messaging Applications. Sensors, Mobiles, Web Browsers and Application Servers could be connected by *EMQ X* brokers with asynchronous PUB/SUB MQTT messages.

The 1.0 release of the *EMQ X* broker has scaled to 1.3 million concurrent MQTT connections on a 12 Core, 32G CentOS server.
